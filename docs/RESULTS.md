# Results

Status: `SMOKE_VALIDATED`.

No causal scientific mechanism result has been produced yet. The current results are CPU smoke validation only.

| Result ID | Claim | Evidence Level | Config | Metrics | Commit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTRL-000 | CPU resource guard can inspect the current machine without heavy downloads. | Availability | `configs/resource/cpu_vps.yaml` | stdout only | pending | `SMOKE_VALIDATED` |
| WM-T0-001 | Tiny action-conditioned JEPA predicts PointMass2D latent transitions better than mean, no-action, and shuffled-action controls in the CPU smoke setting. | Availability | `configs/experiments/tiny_jepa_smoke.yaml` | `artifacts/metrics/tiny_jepa_smoke.json` | `0cab19a6c39c98b59f1a2172eb11a64ec5a566a4` | `SMOKE_VALIDATED` |
| LLM-MOCK-001 | Mock intervention-JEPA predicts held-out direct intervention effects better than no-change, mean-effect, and linear-context baselines in a deterministic mock transformer. | Availability | `configs/experiments/mock_qwen_intervention_jepa_smoke.yaml` | `artifacts/metrics/mock_qwen_intervention_jepa_smoke.json` | `85c1dbfbe9c824bcca415af13f4a6f34acc95267` | `SMOKE_VALIDATED` |
