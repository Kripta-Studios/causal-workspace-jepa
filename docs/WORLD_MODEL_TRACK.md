# World Model Track

Status: `SMOKE_VALIDATED`.

Initial implementation order:

1. deterministic Tier 0 environments: implemented;
2. tiny NumPy action-conditioned JEPA: implemented;
3. no-action and shuffled-action controls: implemented;
4. named activations: implemented for tiny JEPA;
5. interventions and matched controls: pending Milestone 2;
6. planning smoke loop: implemented;
7. workspace criteria with null-result-safe controls: pending Milestone 3.

Published world-model adapters are `BLOCKED_RESOURCE` on the CPU VPS.

Validated CPU smoke:

- `WM-T0-001` ran on PointMass2D with code commit `0cab19a6c39c98b59f1a2172eb11a64ec5a566a4`.
- Conditioned latent MSE: `1.09e-09`; mean baseline: `0.249`; no-action: `0.135`; shuffled-action: `0.153`.
- This validates deterministic execution and action-conditioning plumbing only. It is not causal mediation evidence.
